// O(1) - constant
// O(logN) - logarithmic
// O(root(N)) - square root
// O(N) - linear
// O(N^2) - quadratic
// O(N^3) - cubic
// 2^N - exponential

//there is two way to analysis time complexity
// - frequency method/ step count method
// - asymptotic notations -> Big O, theta, omega
//Big O = considered for Worst case, Upper bound
//theta = considered for Average case, Tight bound 
//omega = considered for Best case, Lower bound 

//rules(frequency method)
//1. comments , declarations step count is 0
//2. return and assignment statement step count is 1
//3. ignore lower order exponents when higher order exponents is present
//4. ignore constant multipliers
