/**
//graph - non-linear data structure, a set of nodes/vertices and edges
//edge = is the line between two nodes
i)Bipertite graphs
there will be two list. they will be connected with each other not connected with their own element
ii)Complete Graph
all nodes connected with each other. example: resort's different building connection
edges = n*(n-1)/2
//graph can be rooted or unrooted
//DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph, exmpl - can't msg mark jackerbarg
//DCG = Directed Cyclic Graph
//self-loop
//multi edge
//represantation - matrix, list, edge list
//traversing - dfs, bfs
