The size of the grid is N*M squares, where ‘s’ means where you should start, ‘.’ means there is a path, ‘x’ means there is no path and ‘e’ means where you should stop. You can walk left, right, up, and down through the cell of squares. You need to tell the minimum number of steps you need to go from ‘S’ to ‘E’ and also you need to print the path in the form of R(Right), L(Left), U(Up) and D(Down) from source to destination. There will be exactly one ‘s’ and one ‘e’. If there is no path, print -1.
